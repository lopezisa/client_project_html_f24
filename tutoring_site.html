            <p> There are a bunch of resources available for tutoring at UMSI! Tutoring resources are essential tools that enhance the learning experience for students of all ages. These resources include online platforms like Khan Academy and Quizlet, which offer interactive lessons and practice exercises tailored to various subjects. Local libraries often provide free access to tutoring sessions and workshops, while educational apps like Duolingo and Photomath support language learning and math problem-solving, respectively. Additionally, many schools have peer tutoring programs that connect students with their classmates for personalized help. These resources not only bolster academic skills but also foster a sense of community and collaboration among learners.</p>
