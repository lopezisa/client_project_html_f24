            <p> CAPS is committed to being the main mental health resource for all students.  We also know, oftentimes, a student's mental and emotional health needs are helped by other student support offices on campus, and/or a student's treatment needs are beyond the scope of CAPS.  This page organizes the many rich resources available at the University of Michigan and in our Ann Arbor community for student mental health and is intended for a variety of constituents -- students, faculty, staff, parents, family members, and loved ones. </p>
